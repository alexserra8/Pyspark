# Pyspark & Machine Learning Repository

In this repository there are many exercices regarding Pyspark (in jupyternotebook):

* **1_Initial_Test** --> just first example to understand how Pyspark works

* **2_Pyspark_SQL** --> exercices using Pyspark mixed with SQL

* **3_Pyspark_MachineLearning** --> final exercices where a dataset has been preproces and adaptated to finally traing a Machine Learning Pipeline. In concrete we predicted with a Logistic Regression model if a fligth will be delayed or not.

# Why?

The idea behind this repository is keep learning Pyspark while creating real Machine Learning applications.
